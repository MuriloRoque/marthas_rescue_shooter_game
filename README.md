Kindly check the Game Design Document I made before starting out: [GDD](src/assets/docs/gdd.md)

In this project I:

- Used Javascript and Phaser 3 to implement a Shooter Game;
- Used the following packages apart from the standard ones:
  - phaser
  - phaser3-rex-plugins
  - webpack
  - jest
- Set up ESlint in the repository;
- Created effective JavaScript code, that solved the problem;
- Used Webpack;
- Used ES6+;
- Dealt with async code;
- Tested the code using Jest;
- Sent and received data from a back-end endpoint;
- Used JSON format;
- Deployed the app to Netlify;
- Translated business requirements into software solutions;
- Multitasked and effectively manage time and prioritization;
- Used strong English verbal communication;
- Used strong English written communication;
- Communicated information effectively to technical people.

# How to play

- When the App is executed, you will see four buttons:
  - Leaderboard: Allows you to check the high scores leaderboard;
  - Credits: Shows you the credits scene, with everyone who helped me building this app;
  - Options: In the next screen, it allows you to mute the music and/or the sound;
  - Start: Starts the game.

- When the game starts, the story's intro and a dialogue will be played;
- When you are able to control the plane, use the ARROW keys to move and the SPACE key to shoot;
- After some time, the boss will appear and, if you are able to defeat it, you can move to the next stage and get a bonus!
- If you take 3 damage, the plane will explode, you will be able to restart the last stage;
- Your score will only be saved if you can pass the first stage!
